Microservices Day 2 Recap and GitHub Repo Link

Day 2 Reaction
Overall, the experience from those 2 days were fun. I am now able to appreciate how microservices enable separation of concern, not
only on the code-level (since you focus on what you work on based on the contract) but also on the deployment level (you can deploy
these microservices separately, so if one service needs to be updated/modifed, the others won't be affected).

Group 1
They made good use of automated deployment
Presentation is well-prepared given the short amount time, especially the slides

Group 2
Well-prepared slides
They should have decided on what to use at first (in-memory or database) so that they won't have to create 2 applications/deployments
